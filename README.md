# Dota-3

## Installation
Dota 3 can be installed by downloading this git repository and ensuring that you merge the "content" and "game" folder from this repo with your own "content" and "game" folders. These should be located in your "\SteamApps\common\dota 2 beta" folder. Be sure you don't use the "dota_ugc" folder!  <-- Same as Barebones
